<h1> Memorial Union Terrace!</h1>

<h2> What is the Memorial Union Terrace </h2>

<p> At the memorial union terrace, you can sit down and enjoy a delicious meal while doing work and watching the sunset! It is the most serene and peaceful spot along Lake Mendota. As a student and a tourist, this location is known for its colorful chairs and lively atmosphere. </p>

<p> The terrace has been around for many years and is one of the most popular attracitions here on campus! The picture below is an image I captured last semester during a beautiful fall sunset! <p>
