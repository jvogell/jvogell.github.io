<h1> Welcome to my Website!</h1>

<h2> Who is Jessie Vogel you ask? </h2>

<p> My name is Jessie Vogel and I am a sophomore at UW Madison! My pronouns are she/her/hers. </p>

<p> I am originally from New York but love my time spent here in Madison where I take my classes virtually. One of my most favorite parts about Madison are the many places where you can go to take in the marvelous views of the city. There are a number of spots which I have visited that I would love to share! On my website, I will provide a few of my favorite spots so that you too can experience the beauty of this city I am proud to call home!
